#### Questions

>What type of variable name casing do you use in JavaScript? (think of snakes or camels)

A: camelCase

>If you want to create a variable called mentor and set its value equal to the name of your mentor, how would you do that?

A:
var mentor;
mentor = 'John Fecko';

>How would you then log the value of mentor to the console?

A:

var mentor;

function getName()
{
mentor = 'John Fecko';
  console.log(mentor);

>Describe the difference between let, var, and const.

A:
The scope of a variable defined with `let` is only limited to a portion of a function. Variables declared with `var` is scoped to the entire function. We use `const` to 

declare variables that we want to have a permanent assigned value.

#### Code Practice
Using var, let and const create 3 variables that will hold your name, state, and hair color.

```javascript
var name;

function greet(name){

const hairColor = 'magenta';

let state = 'excited';


if(name == 'Byron'){

state = 'hyped';
}

return name + ' ' + state + ' ' + hairColor;
}

```
`> greet('Byron');`


`> "Byron hyped magenta"`
